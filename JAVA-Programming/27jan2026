Static Method
    changable but storing only one copy into the memory even if we create multiple object of same variable then in memory only one 
    copy will get stored. static method can be stored once but non- static method can be stored multiple time as many time we are 
    create an object. static method is called directly but non static method you need to create a object 


VARIABLE 
    1. local (limited to scope)
        A variable which is declared inside the body of the method or method parameter.
    2. instance (limited to instance/class)
        A variable which is declared inside the class but outside of all the method.
    3. static (no-limitation / widely accepted)
        A variable which is declared with the help of static key
